# Tiny Tapeout VHDL Demo

This is an experimental project to demonstrate how to use Tiny Tapeout to build an ASIC from VHDL. This project has not been verified - use at your own risk!

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## VHDL Projects

Edit the [config.json](config.json) and make sure that all your source files are listed under VHDL_FILES, and that `DESIGN_NAME` is set to the top level module name. Also update your [info.yaml](info.yaml) file with the top level module name.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [OpenLane 2](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/).

## How to enable the GitHub actions to build the ASIC files

Please see the instructions for:
